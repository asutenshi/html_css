                    <h2>London</h2>
                    <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
                    <p>The central part of London is full of historical remains. Nearly every building, every bridge, every street, palace, house, and stone each of them has its own story, its own past. In London past and present are so mixed together that they cannot easily be separated and when you are in London you see the past in the present and the present in the past.</p>

                    <h2>The Best things of London</h2>
                    <p>One of the largest and the most commercially successful cities in the world, London is also regarded as the financial heart of the United Kingdom. The city is made of two ancient cities, the City of Westminster and the City of London. London, capital of United Kingdom, is an exhilarating fusion of unyielding tradition and free- spirited avant-garde. With spellbinding attractions like Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Tower Bridge and London Eye, it is a perfect tourism magnet.</p>
                    <p>Abbey, Tower Bridge and London Eye, it is a perfect tourism magnet.
                        If royalty fails to entice you, the numerous catacombs of the creepy London Dungeon or the wax images of stars in the Madame Tussaud's Museum will surely do the trick. Besides, London is second best to none, when it comes to modern pleasures and leisure for the Londoners.</p>
